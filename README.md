Project Summary Report Project Title:

**Data Analysis using NumPy and Pandas ** **Objective: ** The main objective of this project is to perform data analysis and manipulation using Python libraries NumPy and Pandas. The project demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and summarize data efficiently.

**Tools and Technologies Used: ** Category Tools / Technologies Programming Language Python 3 Libraries NumPy, Pandas IDE / Editor VS Code / Jupyter Notebook Version Control Git Repository Management GitHub Desktop & GitHub Project Description:

The project imports a dataset using Pandas DataFrame.

Performs operations like filtering, grouping, sorting, and statistical analysis.

Uses NumPy for numerical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).

Generates summary reports of the data.

The entire project is version-controlled and hosted on GitHub using GitHub Desktop.

**Steps Performed: ** Installed required libraries (pip install pandas numpy).

Loaded dataset (pd.read_csv() or created data manually).

Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates).

Used NumPy for mathematical operations.

Used Pandas for data summarization (groupby, describe, mean, etc.).

Committed and pushed code to GitHub using GitHub Desktop.

**Output / Results: ** Displayed summary statistics of the dataset.

Generated insights such as averages, maximum/minimum values, and trends.

Showed how to use Pandas and NumPy together for data analysis.

**Conclusion: ** This project highlights the power of Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas in data analytics. It also demonstrates the use of GitHub Desktop for efficient version control and project sharing.
